# nvim-config
This is my neovim config  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br>
(This is built from many internet sources. I couldn't have written this all.) <br>
Admittably it's still lacking.
# Features
- Nerdtree filemanager
- Inbuilt terminal (normal AND floating)
- Cool themes
- Autocompletion based on open files.
- Cool infobar with triangles
- Discord rich presense
# Installing
So you realise how good it is?
clone this directory with:
```
git clone "https://github.com/Tuhkis/nvim-config.git"
```
Move the files into `~/.config/nvim/` on linux. For others you'll figure it out.

Then run inside Neovim `:PlugInstall` You need vim-plug installed [install vim-plug here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

I'm planning on writing a script for the install (sometime someday)
# Notes
- Use `F12` to open floating terminal.
- You'd like to have [Powerline fonts installed](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
